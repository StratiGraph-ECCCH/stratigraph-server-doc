Working in a room: a guide for editors and administrators
==========================================================

StratiGraph Server · for the archaeologists who work in a study, and for those
who decide who works in it with them. Nothing here needs the node console: all
of it is done from the node's web pages and from the tools.

A room in three sentences
-------------------------

A **room** is where one study is worked on together: its Extended Matrix graph,
the em.json, kept live on the node. Everyone who has a **role** in the room sees
the same graph and every change as it happens, signed with the ORCID of whoever
made it. The room also keeps the study's files, the conversation of the team and
the history of every operation.

Your role in a room
-------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 18 82

   * - Role
     - What you can do
   * - **Reader**
     - Open the room, read the graph, see and download its files, read the
       conversation.
   * - **Editor**
     - Everything a reader does, and write: change the graph, upload files,
       keep snapshots of a Blender file, write in the conversation.
   * - **Administrator**
     - Everything an editor does, and decide about people: add and remove
       editors and readers, make invitation links, decide who sees the study,
       archive the room.
   * - **Owner**
     - One per room. Everything an administrator does, and manage the
       administrators, hand the room to someone else, delete it.

Your role is the same in every tool: the web page, EMStudio, EMtools in Blender,
StratiField on the phone. When a tool refuses something, the sentence it shows
says which role was needed.

Signing in
----------

Open the node's address in a browser — the one your node manager gives you, for
example ``https://192.168.1.214:8443`` — and you are at the **door** of the node:
one sentence on what is done here and one button.

* **With a network**: *Sign in with ORCID*, with your usual ORCID account.
* **On the excavation, without a network**: *sign in with the node's password*.
  User name = your ORCID iD (for example ``0000-0002-1825-0097``), password = the
  field password the node manager gave you. The first time, the node asks you to
  choose your own.

Below the button, without signing in, are the published studies, the tools to
install and this guide.

If you have forgotten the field password, ask the node manager for a new one:
nobody can read the old one, not even them.

Your rooms
----------

After signing in you are in the node's **house**, on **Your rooms**: the rooms
where you hold a role, and no other. Each one has its doors:

* **EMStudio** opens the room in the program installed on your computer. If
  nothing opens within two seconds, the page offers to install EMStudio;
* **In the browser** opens EMStudio in a new tab, with nothing to install;
* **On the phone** shows a QR code: frame it with the phone's camera and
  StratiField opens in that room;
* **EMtools** copies the room's link for Blender: in Blender, EMtools → *Open
  room from link…*, and paste. Beside it, the way to install Blender and EMtools
  the first time.

A link never carries your password or your session: whoever receives it still
signs in with their own identity, and enters only with their own role.

Archived rooms are gathered at the bottom. **New room** is at the top if your
profile on the node allows it (*node editor*); otherwise the page says whom to
ask. Whoever creates a room is its **owner**.

**Tools**, in the column on the left, explains step by step how to install
EMStudio, and Blender (4.4 or later) with EMtools.

One room, opened
----------------

Click a room's name, or *People and sharing*, and the room opens on the right:

* **People and roles** — who works in it, with which role;
* **Invitations** — the links that bring somebody in;
* **Who sees the study** — restricted or public, and the embargo;
* **Lifecycle** — archive, hand over, delete (for whoever governs the room).

A reader or an editor sees the first three as they are, with a sentence saying
who can change them.

Sharing a room — for administrators and owners
----------------------------------------------

The room's panel (*People and sharing*) is where the people of the room are
decided. An editor or a reader sees it with a sentence explaining that this
part belongs to the administrators; *Who sees the study* stays visible to
everyone, read-only.

Adding a person
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In *People and roles*, type the person's **ORCID iD**, choose the role, *Add*.
The person sees the room the next time they open the house. To change a role or
take somebody out, use the menu beside their name.

Give **editor** to whoever writes in the graph, **reader** to whoever needs to
follow the work without changing it — a specialist consulting the data, a
student in the first weeks, a colleague of the superintendence. Give
**administrator** sparingly: an administrator decides about the others.

Adding a team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **team** is a named list of people, made by the node manager or by a node
editor, or written in the node's list (see :doc:`roles-and-users`). Type the
team's id where you would type an ORCID, and the whole team gets the role at
once; whoever joins the team
later gets it too. When a person has a role of their own and one through a
team, the higher one counts.

Inviting with a link
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In *Invitations*, choose the role (editor or reader) and how long the link
lasts, then *Create link*. It is copied for you and shown once — the node keeps
only a checksum and cannot show it again. Whoever opens it arrives at the node's
door, signs in with their own ORCID and finds the room in their house, with the
role the link offers.

Send invitation links in a private message, never in a public chat or on a
slide, and **revoke** a link once the people it was for have come in.

Who sees the study
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two choices, and a date:

* **Restricted** (the default) — only the people with a role in the room, after
  signing in.
* **Public** — anyone can read it, even without signing in. This is what
  publishing means: the study appears in the node's catalogue.
* **Embargo until** a date — until that day the study stays restricted, whatever
  is chosen above; on that day it becomes what you chose. Useful to agree a
  publication date with the excavation director or the superintendence and not
  have to remember it.

Choose, set the date if there is one, *Save*.

The owner
~~~~~~~~~

The owner can **hand the room over** (*Lifecycle*) to
another ORCID iD — for instance when the direction of an excavation changes
hands. The previous owner stays as an administrator. Transferring hands over
the job of managing the room; it does not change who signed what in the graph.

Archiving
~~~~~~~~~

At the end of a season, **archive** the room: it stays readable and citable,
nobody writes in it any more, and it can be brought back at the next season
with *bring it back*. Archiving is the normal way to close; it deletes nothing.

Deleting
~~~~~~~~

Only the **owner** deletes a room, from *Delete the room*, typing the room's id
to confirm. It cannot be undone: the room goes with its em.json and every
revision, its history, its members and its invitations. The files stay on the
node, and the node manager decides about those no other room uses. Nobody may
be inside the room at that moment.

If the room may ever be needed again, archive it instead.

Good habits
-----------

* One room per study. A room is the live copy of one em.json, and each em.json
  lives in one room.
* Before the end of the day, read *The numbers, and their holes* and *Waiting
  for you*: what is unsigned or without an epoch is easier to fix while the
  context is fresh.
* Roles follow the work, not the hierarchy: the person who records the units is
  an editor, whatever their title.
* Agree the visibility and the embargo with the excavation's director at the
  start, not at the end.
* Revoke invitation links after use; remove people who have left the project.
* On the excavation without a network, the work goes on: the node is on site.
  What was written there comes back to the institutional node at the end of the
  campaign, with its signatures.

Where to go next
----------------

The complete rules — profiles on the node, roles, groups, invitations, deleting
— are in :doc:`roles-and-users`. The node itself, and how the field node is
prepared, are in :doc:`field-node`.
